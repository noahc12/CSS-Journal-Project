    I think the creed is important becauseit is what we will live by. The creed is like a building block for a proper way of living, as it tells us to lead by example which means that you have to be a proper person in your everyday life. The creed also tells us to honor the brotherhood that is TXT/SCLA. By doing so we are learning how to properlyrespect each memeber of TXT. By following the "I will think outside the box" creed, we aregoing to learn ow to think critically in new and different ways when we have to solve a problem. After this summer of TXT is over we will use our new found knowledge and "help my neghbour and community" meaning that as TXTers we will think of new ways of helping our community. I think this was the only thing we would have to memorize becasueit essentially is a life motto in which as young men of color; we will succed.

    Lebron James got swept by the OP Warriors lmao!! Now I'm not a Warriors fan not I am a Kobe fan and I'm just glad the Lebron fanboys don't have anything to say when I say neither MJ or Kobe ever got swept in the Finals LOLLLL!! And for those who say Kobe wouldn't have won rings during todays NBA, let me say, Kobe beat the Celtics aka the FIRST superteam; which is the team that made Lebron leave Cleaveland and make his own superteam in Miami in order to even win a ring. He promised more than 7 rings and only deleivered 2 rings like what?? Let me remind you Kobe never formed a superteam and won his rings with Andrew Bynum so yeah case closed. Kobe is GOAT.
